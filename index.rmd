Hello my name is Nathaniel Pyle and I am a Data Scientist. In September 2024 I graduated 
from the University of Canterbury with a Master's Degree in Applied Data Science. The purpose of this website 
is to act as a portfolio for my abilities as a Data Scientist, and for the progression of my career.
