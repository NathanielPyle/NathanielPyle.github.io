<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic
Dataset</h1>

</div>


<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This project involved Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset
available from the <a
href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic">UC
Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With only 569 cases and 30 features, the EDA processes included
Correlation Matrices, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic
Discriminant Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, and T-Distributed
Stochastic Neighbour Embedding.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project was to gain a basic understanding of
which variables are most important in determining whether cancer is
malignant or benign. To identify these key variables, two binary
classification models—Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic
Discriminant Analysis (QDA)—were employed.</p>
<p>To gain a more in-depth understanding of the importance of various
variables, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed
Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) were utilised.</p>
</div>
<div id="methodology" class="section level2">
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Technologies</strong>: Various packages were used
throughout this Exploratory Data Analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin
data, including <code>corrplot</code>, <code>readODS</code>,
<code>dplyr</code>, <code>tidyverse</code>, <code>MASS</code>,
<code>ggplot2</code>, and <code>Rtsne</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods</strong>: It is important to note that some
columns from the original dataset were modified. The ID number was
removed as it did not provide additional benefit to the EDA, and the
diagnosis column was converted to a binary column, where malignant was
classified as 1 and benign as 0. This binary column is referred to as
<code>cancer</code> in the modified dataframe. The <code>cancer</code>
variable was the dependent variable for the EDA processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This project involved creating Correlation Matrices to recognise
which variables have the strongest correlations with others.</p>
<p>To perform LDA, the variables were scaled to have a mean of 0 and a
standard deviation of 1. The means and standard deviations of the scaled
variables were computed. For both LDA and QDA, the data was split into
70% for training and 30% for testing. The model was trained using the
70% training dataset, with the <code>cancer</code> variable as the
response variable. This trained model was then tested using the 30%
testing dataset, and the accuracy was calculated by comparing predicted
versus actual class labels.</p>
<p>QDA followed similar processes, with the exception that the variables
were not scaled, nor were their standard deviations or means computed.
The model was trained using a 70% training and 30% testing split. As
with LDA, the model was trained using the training dataset and tested
using the same processes as LDA.</p>
<p>Principal Component Analysis involved scaling the variables in the
same way as in the LDA processes. The results and scores were then
multiplied by -1 to adjust the direction of the principal components.
The data was explored in descending order, and the results were
calculated. These results represent the proportion of variance explained
by each principal component. Each of the standard deviations of these
principal components was squared to calculate the variance of each
component. The proportion of variance explained is captured in the
variable <code>var_explained</code>.</p>
<p>The t-SNE algorithm involved selecting all variables except for
<code>cancer</code> as it was the dependent variable. Two dimensions,
benign and malignant, were used, with a perplexity of 50. This
perplexity relates to the number of nearest neighbours when computing
the similarities between data points, balancing the local and global
aspects of the data. Using the maximum number of iterations at 1000
allows the algorithm to train and converge effectively. With a
perplexity of 50 and a maximum of 1000 iterations, the model was trained
over 20 epochs. With each epoch, the model’s error decreased
accordingly. This process was visualised in a two-dimensional plot,
separating benign and malignant cases.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level2">
<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Findings</strong>: When creating the correlation
matrices, there was significant overlap between variables, leading to
multicollinearity. As a result, other data science/statistical
techniques such as Principal Component Analysis and T-Distributed
Stochastic Neighbour Embedding were employed instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analysing the correlation matrices, it is evident that variables
plotted against themselves diagonally result in a correlation of 1.0. In
the benign correlation matrix, some variables are highly correlated,
such as compactness, concave points, concavity, and fractal dimensions.
Additionally, variables related to similar subject matters, such as area
and perimeter, also show strong correlations. The malignant correlation
matrix follows a similar pattern, with even stronger relationships
between variables.</p>
<p>Through comparative analysis of LDA and QDA, both models show
specific differences but can be compared in terms of overall accuracy.
LDA produced an accuracy of 94.5% on the testing dataset, while QDA
achieved an accuracy of 95.3%. Both models used an estimated 70%
training and 30% testing split, which is standard practice.
Interestingly, both models showed similar prior probabilities in
detecting whether a cancer case was malignant or benign, at
approximately 65% for benign and 35% for malignant.</p>
<p>In LDA, the <code>radius_mean</code> for malignant cases is -0.5568,
while for benign cases it is 0.9787, indicating that, on average,
<code>radius_mean</code> is higher in malignant cases compared to benign
cases. In terms of coefficients, <code>radius_worst</code> has the
largest positive coefficient of 5.7927, strongly influencing the
classification of whether the cancer is malignant or benign. To a lesser
degree, <code>perimeter_mean</code> also influences the classification
of cancer cases, with a coefficient of 3.7534.</p>
<p>Analysing the group means for QDA, the <code>radius_mean</code> for
benign cases is 12.1141, whereas for malignant cases it is 17.12036,
indicating that <code>radius_mean</code> is larger for malignant cases
than for benign cases. Other group means, such as
<code>texture_mean</code>, show slightly higher values for malignant
cases (21.60877) compared with benign cases (17.92915). The variables
<code>perimeter_mean</code>, <code>area_mean</code>, and
<code>area_se</code> are the most extreme examples.</p>
<p>In summary, comparing LDA and QDA using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin
(Diagnostic) dataset, QDA performs slightly better, indicating that the
data is not perfectly linear. The difference in performance is minimal,
and it is possible to improve the overall accuracy of both models.
However, doing so could increase the likelihood of overfitting.</p>
<p>Through the use of Principal Component Analysis, correlations between
the original dataset are analysed. Unlike the correlation matrices, PCA
is not susceptible to multicolinearity, and is capable of capturing the
greatest variation among the dataset. Inspecting the results, with PC1
having the greatest variation among all of the Principal Components, it
is clear to see that the greatest variation is in the radius_mean,
perimeter_mean and area_mean with values of 0.2163, 0.2245 and 0.2179.
In conjunction with this, PC2, second to PC1, explains other variation
not covered by PC1 such as smoothness_mean and compactness_mean with
values of 0.1887 and 0.1547. These findings are further explained
through the use of the Scree plot below.</p>
<p>The results from the t-SNE algorithm reduced the overall error from
49.1515 at the beginning to 0.1687 at the end. The total time taken for
this algorithm to fit and train the model was 1.39 seconds, indicating
that it is computationally efficient. This is likely due to the
relatively small dataset, despite the large number of variables.
Interestingly, there is some overlap between data points, meaning that
in some instances where cancer is malignant or benign, there may be some
uncertainty.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Takeaways</strong>: In conclusion, the analysis of the
correlation matrices reveals that variables with the strongest
correlations are size-based variables. There is some multicollinearity,
where plotting the same variable against itself results in a correlation
of 1.0. LDA and QDA were then used to explain the coefficients and group
means for the purpose of binary classification. Interestingly, QDA
slightly outperforms LDA, indicating that the original data may not be
perfectly linear. For further explanation about the variation among
variables, Principal Component Analysis was employed. The most variation
was explained in the first and second principal components, with a
decreasing amount of variation explained by the subsequent components.
This is further illustrated through the use of the t-SNE algorithm,
where the model is trained. The purpose of this was to illustrate the
difference between the first and second principal components and convey
the difference between benign and malignant cases. As shown in the
visualisation, there is some overlap between benign and malignant
cases.</li>
